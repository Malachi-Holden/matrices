Project I created early in my computer science learning.

Visualization for linear transformations and solving systems of linear equations

To operate:

Download all three files: matrix.py, equation_solver.py, linear_trans.py

it's easiest to use git clone for this


To solve linear equations run the command

python3 equation_solver.py

to visualize linear transformations run

python3 linear_trans.py
